# Distributed-Score-based-Multiround-Mechanism

The DSM_mechanism.m implements a negotiation based on the DSM mechanism proposed in the followoing paper:

Farhadi, F., Jennings, N.R.: A Faithful Mechanism for Incremental Multi-Agent Agreement Problems with Self-Interested and Privacy-Preserving Agents.

Before running DSM_mechanism.m, one should run function Calculate_t_p_three_levels.m to derive the reward function and belief functions. This function runs Algorithm 1 in the paper.
